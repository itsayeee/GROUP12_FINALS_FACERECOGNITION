  The **Department of Education (DepEd)** is the principal government agency responsible for the administration and regulation of the basic education system in the Philippines. Founded in 1863, DepEd's primary goal is to provide quality and accessible education to all Filipino learners from kindergarten to Grade 12. It oversees public and private schools, develops the national curriculum, implements educational policies, and ensures the continuous enhancement of the educational system to meet the evolving needs of students and the demands of a rapidly changing world. DepEd plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of the nation by fostering holistic development, critical thinking, and lifelong learning among its students.
